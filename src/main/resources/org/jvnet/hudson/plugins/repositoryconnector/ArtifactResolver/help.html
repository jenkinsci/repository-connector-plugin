<div>Define the artifacts you would like to download.<br />
The target directory defines where the artifacts should be copied to.
The coordinates are as you know it from maven or ivy:<br />
GroupId: This is generally unique amongst an organization or a project.<br />
ArtifactId: The artifactId is generally the name that the project is known by.<br />
Version: The version of the artifact to be resolved. The dynamic definitions 'RELEASE' (the latest release) and 'LATEST' (the latest build) are allowed too.<br />
Classifier: It is some optional and arbitrary string that - if present - is appended to the artifact name just after the version number.<br />
Extension: This is the extension of the artifact to be resolved. Important: this is not always the same as 'packaging' in maven! (although it might be the same e.g. for 'jar')<br />
Target file name: should the file have a different name after downloading? You can also define a subdirectory.<br />
