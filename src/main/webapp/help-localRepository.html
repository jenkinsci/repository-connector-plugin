  Local repository for resolved artifacts and metadata.
  
  <p>This may point to a path containing an existing maven repository or be a completely separate directory. If you are using
  non-ephemeral storage, this directory can be cleaned up from time to time at the expense of resolving the artifact(s) again.</p>
